We need to make 2 changes: 

# Slide distance

In general, when I change slide distance, the LAST frame should stay in place, and the preceding slides should move. 


## "Hero Shot"

The "Hero Shot" currently works so that the camera moves from the current view to a view where the last frame is front & center and fully visible, fitting into the frame. 

Then the view waits for a given time, and then performs the reverse. 

This is all good, except one thing: 

The change is: When we perform the hero shot, then during the hero shot the slide distance should get smoothly reduced to 0 (at the point where we see the last frame front & center), and then smoothly back to the user-defined slide distance.
