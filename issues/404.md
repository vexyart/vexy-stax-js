# Problems

- [ ] The studio canvas default size should be 960x540 and not 1920x1080
- [ ] Beauty viewpoint needs to visually center the entire stack within the current studio canvas, both horizontally and vertically, in both ambient and nonambient modes
- [ ] Front viewpoint needs to fit the front view on the last slide into the current studio canvas, both horizontally and vertically (we leave padding to account for the potential aspect ration differences), in both ambient and nonambient modes
- [ ] Hero shot animation needs to animate from current ("original") viewpoint to SPECIAL FRONT VIEWPOINT where we reduce the slide distance from user-defined to 0, the animation needs to wait, and then it needs to animate back to the original viewpoint and user-defined slide distance. 
- [ ] Adding slides, changing viewpoint, and triggering the hero shot all need to be controllable via Playwright as well.
